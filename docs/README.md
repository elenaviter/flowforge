# Welcome to FlowForge

FlowForge helps Node-RED developers deliver applications in a more reliable,
collaborative, and secure manner. Node-REDâ€™s intuitive, low-code development
environment is great for connecting together hardware devices, APIs, and online
services.

FlowForge adds to Node-RED; collaborative development, management of
remote deployments, support for DevOps delivery pipelines, and the ability to
host Node-RED applications on FlowForge. FlowForge is the DevOps platform for
